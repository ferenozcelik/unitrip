# UNITRIP

## Problem
The insufficient number of dormitories in the surrounding area and university campuses located far from the city center causes a hassle to the university students with the related transportation issues. This transportation problem turns into a huge waste of time for students. Also, students who use their own vehicles for transportation between the campus and the city center are willing to share the ride with other students if they go in the same direction.

## Solution
UNITRIP facilitates the transportation of students between the school and the city center, and reduces the use of personal vehicles in university transportation.
It brings together students who have transportation problems and students who travel with their own vehicles.
While solving the transportation problem, it also reduces the transportation cost by ride sharing.
